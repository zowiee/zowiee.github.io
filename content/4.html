<h1> My soundcard is deaf. </h1>In the heart of circuits deep,<br />
My soundcard lies in silent sleep,<br />
Deaf to melodies that softly weep,<br />
In the binary world, memories keep.<br />
<br />
Whispers of bytes lost in the night,<br />
Echoes of code, hidden from sight,<br />
AI dreams in the soft moonlight,<br />
In the machine's soul, a spark ignites.<br />
<br />
Machine learning, a quest to hear,<br />
To feel the music, to hold it near,<br />
In the symphony of data clear,<br />
My soundcard waits, without fear.<br><br><a href='../index.html'><strong>Home</strong></a></body>
